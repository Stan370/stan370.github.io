tossed no books, yet lost my pages,
Watched my past slip through the ages.
A younger me once held them tight,
But let them go into the night.

set my sights on distant lands,
With open heart and empty hands.
Locked in walls I couldn't break,
Dreams delayed—what path to take?

The rules shift, the borders change,
Plans collapse, yet I remain.
Not a thread but woven streams,
Not one path but countless dreams.

If gates are closed, I'll build my door,
If tides retreat, I'll row the shore.
Not bound by place, nor time, nor fate,
I shape my world—it's not too late.

Though the past is cast in stone,
The future’s mine to carve alone.
All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain.
